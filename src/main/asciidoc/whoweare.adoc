= Who We Are

== Who We Are

The DB Project operates on a meritocracy: the more you do, the more responsibility you will
obtain. This page lists all of the people who have gone the extra mile and are Committers or
members of the Project Management Committee. If you would like to get involved, the first
step is to join the link:mail.html[mailing lists].

We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for support. We are non-paid
volunteers who help out with the project and we do not necessarily have the time or energy
to help people on an individual basis. Instead, we have setup link:mail.html[mailing lists] which often
contain hundreds of individuals who will help answer detailed requests for help. The benefit
of using mailing lists over private communication is that it is a shared resource where
others can also learn from common mistakes and as a community we all grow together.
